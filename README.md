UT Austin Coding Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description

The included index.html and style.css files have been refactored for accessibility standards for Horiseon Social Solutions.
The additions will allow for increased efficiency functionality and for future modifications.
There are multiple cosolidations on the CSS file that decrease repetitive rules 
Through this process we can see the refactoring process to gain a better understanding of semantic HTML elements, functional links, accessible alt attributes, sequential heading attributes, and descriptive title.
